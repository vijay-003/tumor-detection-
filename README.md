Introduction : The human body is made up of many organs and brain is the most critical and vital
organ of them all. One of the common reasons for dysfunction of brain is brain tumor. A
tumor is nothing but excess cells growing in an uncontrolled manner. Brain tumor cells
grow in a way that they eventually take up all the nutrients meant for the healthy cells and
tissues, which results in brain failure. Currently, doctors locate the position and the area of
brain tumor by looking at the MR Images of the brain of the patient manually. This results
in inaccurate detection of the tumor and is considered very time consuming. A Brain
Cancer is very critical disease which causes deaths of many individuals. The brain tumor
detection and classification system is available so that it can be diagnosed at early stages.
Cancer classification is the most challenging tasks in clinical diagnosis. This project deals
with such a system, which uses computer, based procedures to detect tumor blocks and
classify the type of tumor using Convolution Neural Network Algorithm for MRI images
of different patients. Different types of image processing techniques like image
segmentation, image enhancement and feature extraction are used for the brain tumor
detection in the MRI images of the cancer-affected patients. Detecting Brain tumor using
Image Processing techniques its involves the four stages is Image Pre-Processing, Image
segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification. Image processing and neural network
techniques are used for improve the performance of detecting and classifying brain tumor
in MRI images.
